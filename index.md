## Other Screens

### Broadcast Booth

The Broadcast Booth offers deep insights into an in-progress match. If the match is part of a season then the players' season standings and stats will be present at the top. The live scoreboard is embedded on the left side of the screen, while the right side contains realtime match stats updated after each throw.
