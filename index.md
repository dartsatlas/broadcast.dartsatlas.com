## Other Screens

### Broadcast Booth

The Broadcast Booth is meant to be the broadcaster's view into the match. Designed to be displayed full-screen in a secondary monitor beside your video feed(s), the booth offers valuable insights and full leg history for your match. If the match is part of a season then the players' season standings and stats will be rendered at the top. The live scoreboard is embedded on the left side of the screen, while the right side contains leg counts and match stats.
